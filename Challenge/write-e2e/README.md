# End-to-End Tests for README.md

This document contains end-to-end tests for the project using Cypress.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Cypress installed in your project. If not, install it using:
    ```sh
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

## Test Suite
# End-to-End (E2E) Testing Project

## Introduction

End-to-end testing ensures that your application works as expected from the user's perspective. It tests the entire application flow, from the user interface to the backend services.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the necessary testing libraries.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev cypress
    ```

2. **Initialize Cypress**: Run the following command to initialize Cypress in your project.

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

3. **Project Structure**: Your project structure should look like this:

    ```
    /PROJECTS/LEANING/aicodex3/Challenge/
    ├── cypress/
    │   ├── fixtures/
    │   ├── integration/
    │   ├── plugins/
    │   └── support/
    ├── cypress.json
    └── package.json
    ```

## Writing Tests

1. **Create Test Files**: Add your test files in the `cypress/integration/` directory.

    ```javascript
    // cypress/integration/sample_spec.js
    describe('My First Test', () => {
      it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
        cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
        cy.contains('type').click()
        cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')
        cy.get('.action-email').type('fake@email.com')
          .should('have.value', 'fake@email.com')
      })
    })
    ```

## Running Tests

1. **Run Cypress**: Use the following command to open the Cypress Test Runner.

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

2. **Run Tests in Headless Mode**: To run tests in headless mode, use:

    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state left by previous tests.
- **Use Selectors Wisely**: Use data attributes for selecting elements to avoid brittle tests.
- **Clean Up State**: Ensure that your tests clean up any state they create.

Happy Testing!
